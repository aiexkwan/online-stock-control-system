# Admin Dashboard Widget Auto-Refresh Removal - Complete

## Summary
All auto-refresh mechanisms have been successfully removed from admin dashboard widgets. Data will now only be loaded/refreshed in these cases:
1. Initial page load / First time loading
2. User manually clicks the Refresh button

## Changes Made

### Widgets Fixed (removed setInterval auto-refresh):
1. **VoidPalletWidget.tsx** - Removed interval that refreshed data every 60 seconds
2. **MaterialReceivedWidget.tsx** - Removed interval that refreshed GRN count every 60 seconds  
3. **DatabaseUpdateWidget.tsx** - Removed interval that refreshed recent updates every 60 seconds
4. **DocumentUploadWidget.tsx** - Removed interval that refreshed upload history every 60 seconds

### Verification Complete
- Checked all 22 widget files in `/app/admin/components/dashboard/widgets/`
- Confirmed NO remaining `setInterval` or `setTimeout` calls
- All widgets now use either:
  - `useWidgetData` hook (manual refresh only)
  - Simple `useEffect` without timers
  - User-triggered data loads

## Widget Behavior After Changes

### Data Loading Patterns:
1. **Initial Load**: Data loads once when widget mounts
2. **Manual Refresh**: Data reloads when user clicks the refresh button (via `AdminRefreshContext`)
3. **User Actions**: Data reloads in response to specific user interactions (searches, filters, etc.)

### No More Auto-Refresh:
- No background timers running
- No periodic data fetching
- No unexpected network requests
- Better performance and user control

## Technical Details

The `refreshInterval` configuration in widget registry (`index.ts`) is now unused but left in place for potential future use or backward compatibility. It does not trigger any auto-refresh behavior.

All widgets properly respond to the manual refresh button through the `AdminRefreshContext` and `refreshTrigger` mechanism.
