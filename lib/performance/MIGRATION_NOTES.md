# GraphQL Performance Monitor Migration

## Migration Date: 2025-08-26

### Overview
Successfully migrated GraphQL performance monitoring from `/lib/monitoring` to `/lib/performance` to consolidate all performance-related functionality.

### Files Migrated
1. **Source**: `/lib/monitoring/graphql-performance-monitor.ts`
   - **Destination**: `/lib/performance/graphql-performance-monitor.ts`
   - **Status**: ✅ Complete - Created new file with all functionality preserved

### Import Updates
1. **Updated**: `/lib/graphql/apollo-client.ts`
   - Changed import from `@/lib/monitoring/graphql-performance-monitor` to `@/lib/performance/graphql-performance-monitor`
   - **Status**: ✅ Complete

2. **Updated**: `/lib/performance/index.ts`
   - Added exports for GraphQL performance monitoring components
   - Exported: `graphqlPerformanceMonitor`, `PerformanceLink`, `generatePerformanceReport`
   - Exported types: `GraphQLMetrics`, `GraphQLPerformanceStats`
   - **Status**: ✅ Complete

### Functionality Preserved
- ✅ GraphQL metrics collection

- ✅ Slow query detection and logging
- ✅ Error tracking

### Verification Steps Completed
1. ✅ TypeScript compilation check passed
2. ✅ No remaining references to old import path
3. ✅ All exports properly configured in index.ts

### Original File Status
The original file at `/lib/monitoring/graphql-performance-monitor.ts` has been preserved as backup until full system verification is complete.

### Next Steps
1. Run full test suite to verify functionality
2. Monitor production deployment for any issues
3. Remove original file after verification period (recommended: 1 week)

### Architecture Benefits
- Centralized performance monitoring in single directory
- Better code organization and discoverability
- Consistent API for all performance-related features
- Easier maintenance and updates
