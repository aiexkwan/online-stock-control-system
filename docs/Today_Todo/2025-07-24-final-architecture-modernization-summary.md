---

## 🎯 Architecture Consistency Achieved

### Unified Card Pattern
All Cards now follow the same architectural pattern:
```typescript
interface UnifiedCardProps {
  dateRange?: DateRange;
  isEditMode: boolean;
  refreshInterval?: number;
  // Card-specific props
}

// GraphQL Integration
const { data, loading, error } = useQuery(CARD_QUERY);
const [mutation] = useMutation(CARD_MUTATION);

// Unified Error Handling
if (error) return <CardErrorFallback />;
if (loading) return <CardLoadingSkeleton />;
```

### Consistent Naming Conventions
- **Component Names**: `[Type]Card.tsx` (e.g., `ConfigCard.tsx`)
- **GraphQL Queries**: `GET_[TYPE]_DATA` pattern
- **GraphQL Mutations**: `UPDATE_[TYPE]_DATA` pattern
- **Props Interfaces**: `[Type]CardProps` pattern
