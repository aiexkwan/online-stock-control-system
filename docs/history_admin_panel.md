## Recent Major Improvements

### 2024-06-25: Auto-Reprint Label Enhancement

**Problem Solved**: 
- Updated auto-reprint functionality to use atomic pallet number generation
- Ensured consistency with main QC/GRN label printing systems

**Solution Implemented**:
- Modified `app/api/auto-reprint-label/route.ts` to use `generate_atomic_pallet_numbers_v2()`
- Enhanced error handling for atomic pallet generation failures
- Improved logging and debugging capabilities

**Technical Details**:
- Replaced old `generatePalletNumbers()` with atomic RPC function
- Added proper validation for returned pallet numbers
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing auto-reprint workflow

**Files Modified**:
- `app/api/auto-reprint-label/route.ts` - Updated pallet generation logic

**Benefits**:
- Eliminated potential duplicate pallet numbers in auto-reprint scenarios
- Unified pallet generation across all system components
- Improved reliability for automated operations
