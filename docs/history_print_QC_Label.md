### 2024-06-25: Atomic Pallet Number Generation Implementation

**Problem Solved**: 
- Fixed duplicate pallet number generation issue caused by race conditions
- Error: `duplicate key value violates unique constraint "record_palletinfo_pkey"`

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created atomic pallet number generation using `generate_atomic_pallet_numbers_v2()` RPC function
- Implemented `daily_pallet_sequence` table for sequence management
- Replaced old `generatePalletNumbers()` with atomic version in `app/actions/qcActions.ts`

**Technical Details**:
- Added `daily_pallet_sequence` table with atomic UPDATE operations
- Used `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT` for race condition prevention
- Implemented automatic cleanup of old sequence records (7+ days)
- Added performance monitoring with `monitor_pallet_generation_performance_v2()`

**Files Modified**:
- `app/actions/qcActions.ts` - Updated to use atomic RPC function
- `scripts/fix-atomic-pallet-generation.sql` - New atomic functions
- `lib/atomicPalletUtils.ts` - TypeScript wrapper functions

**Testing Results**:
- Concurrent test: 10 requests Ã— 3 pallets = 30 unique numbers (0 duplicates)
- Performance: 164ms for 10 concurrent requests
- All edge cases handled properly

**Impact**: 
- Eliminated pallet number duplication completely
- Improved system reliability for multi-user environments
- Enhanced performance monitoring capabilities
