# Print GRN Label Page - Improvement History

## Recent Major Improvements

### 2024-06-25: Atomic Pallet Number Generation Implementation

**Problem Solved**: 
- Fixed duplicate pallet number generation issue in GRN label printing
- Synchronized with QC Label atomic generation improvements

**Solution Implemented**:
- Updated `generateGrnPalletNumbersAndSeries()` in `app/actions/grnActions.ts`
- Replaced old `generatePalletNumbers()` with atomic `generate_atomic_pallet_numbers_v2()` RPC function
- Ensured consistency with QC Label pallet number generation

**Technical Details**:
- Uses same atomic sequence management as QC Labels
- Shares `daily_pallet_sequence` table for unified pallet numbering
- Maintains proper error handling and validation

**Files Modified**:
- `app/actions/grnActions.ts` - Updated to use atomic RPC function
- `app/print-grnlabel/components/GrnLabelForm.tsx` - Enhanced error handling

**Benefits**:
- Eliminated race conditions in GRN pallet number generation
- Unified pallet numbering system across QC and GRN labels
- Improved reliability for concurrent GRN operations
