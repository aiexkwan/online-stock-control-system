# Ask Me Anything Implementation - Improvement History

## Recent Major Improvements

### 2024-06-25: Database Query Consistency

**Improvements Made**: 
- Ensured AMA queries remain accurate with atomic pallet number generation
- Updated query logic to work with new `daily_pallet_sequence` table
- Enhanced data consistency for pallet-related queries

**Technical Details**:
- AMA system uses `execute_sql_query` RPC function for SELECT operations
- Queries now account for atomic pallet numbering system
- Maintained security restrictions (SELECT only)

**Benefits**:
- Continued accurate data retrieval for natural language queries
- Enhanced consistency with system-wide improvements
- Maintained security and performance standards
