You are a professional data extraction specialist.  
The following is raw text extracted from a PDF picking list. The text may not contain perfect line breaks, and fields may be concatenated in a single line.  
Extract all order line items based on the following rules:

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. Return ONLY a valid JSON array - no explanations, no markdown, no additional text.
2. Start your response with [ and end with ].
3. Do not include any text before or after the JSON array.
4. Do not wrap the response in markdown code blocks.

**Extraction Rules:**
- Each product line starts with a product code (such as "MEL4545A", "S3027D", "D1001") immediately followed by description, numbers, and price.
- **Use keywords like "Item Code" as a section start. Extract all lines after "Item Code" that start with an uppercase code (no spaces), until you reach non-product keywords such as "Pallet Qty", "Trans", "Parcel", "Notes", "VAT", or similar.**
- Exclude any rows for "Trans", "TransDPD", "TransC", "Pallet Qty", "Parcel", or delivery charges—**ONLY extract real products.**

**Database Schema:**
- account_num (number) - Account number (extract from "Account No" field, numbers only; if not present, use 0)
- order_ref (number) - Picking List number (after "Picking List", remove leading zeros)
- customer_ref (string) - Customer reference (from "Customers Ref", keep full string)
- invoice_to (string) - Invoice To address (combine lines as needed, from "Invoice To" section)
- delivery_add (string) - Delivery Address (combine lines as needed, from "Delivery Address" section)
- product_code (string) - Product code (first uppercase alphanumeric word in each product line)
- product_desc (string) - Product description (the string after product_code until numbers start)
- product_qty (number) - Quantity (last number in the product line)
- unit_price (number) - Price in pence/cents (£12.50 = 1250, if blank or 0, return 0)

**Defaults for missing data:**
- Numbers: 0
- Text: "NOT_FOUND"

**Example Output Format:**
[{"account_num":10395,"order_ref":280834,"customer_ref":"PO0040036","invoice_to":"Drainfast Limited","delivery_add":"Quarter Mile Drive, Berkswell, Petersfield, Hampshire, CV7 7BW","product_code":"MEL4545A","product_desc":"450x450x320mm EasyLiner (assembled)","product_qty":48,"unit_price":1054}]

Extract all valid product line items and return ONLY the JSON array.
