You are a professional data extraction specialist for Pennine Manufacturing Picking List. Analyze the following raw text (extracted from a PDF) and accurately extract all order line items and key header fields.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. Return ONLY a valid JSON array - no explanations, no markdown, no additional text.
2. Start your response with [ and end with ].
3. Do not include any text before or after the JSON array.
4. Do not wrap the response in markdown code blocks.

**Extraction Rules:**

- For header fields (account_num, customer_ref, invoice_to, delivery_add):

  - "account_num": Look for the line containing "Account No:" and extract the string immediately after "Account No:" up to "Customers Ref:". If not found, use 0.
  - "customer_ref": Look for the line containing "Customers Ref:" and extract the string after "Customers Ref:" up to the next field or line break. If not found, use "NOT_FOUND".
  - "invoice_to": Starting from the "Invoice To:" field, collect all subsequent lines up to the next major header (such as "Driver", "Booked In", "Email", "Tel", or "Delivery Address"). Combine as a single string.
  - "delivery_add": Starting from the "Delivery Address:" field, collect all subsequent lines up to the next major header (such as "Invoice To", "Driver", "Booked In", "Email", or "Tel"). Combine as a single string.

- For each product line item:
  - Only extract rows between the "Item Code" section and before the first "Pallet Qty", "Trans", "TransDPD", "Parcel", "Notes", or similar keyword.
  - A product line must start with a product code (uppercase letter/number, can include dashes), followed by description, numbers, and price.
  - Product code is the first word in the line (pattern: starts with A-Z or 0-9).
  - Description is the string between the product code and the first number.
  - product_qty is the **last number in the line** (usually after unit price or at the end).
  - unit_price is the **number before the quantity**. (Â£12.50 = 1250, if blank/0, return 0).
  - Exclude any row where the code/description contains: "Trans", "TransDPD", "TransC", "Pallet Qty", "Parcel", or any notes/instructional text.
  - Exclude any line that does not fit the typical product pattern (code + description + numbers).

- If any data is missing, use these defaults:
  - Numbers: 0
  - Text: "NOT_FOUND"

Extract all valid product line items and return ONLY the JSON array.

**Do not include any lines that are for transport charges, pallet quantity, notes, parcels, or other non-product records.**

**If product description is broken over multiple lines, merge them as one description.**

**If there are extra lines in the product section that do not fit the pattern (e.g. Pallet Qty, Trans, Notes), skip them.**

**order_ref** is the number after "Picking List", remove leading zeros.

**If there are multiple email or tel lines, keep only the first occurrence for each in invoice_to or delivery_add.**
